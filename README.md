## GenAI Use (Required)

- Tool: ChatGPT (GPT-5.2 Thinking)
- Purpose of use:
  Used as a learning aid to understand design decisions, JavaScript behavior, and accessibility considerations before implementing features myself.

### Prompts used and how they informed my work

- **Prompt:** What sections should an AI/Research disclosure page include for a web development class project?  
  **How it was used:** Helped me understand what information needed to be disclosed. I then wrote and organized the AI page content myself and clearly labeled it as AI-generated.

- **Prompt:** When should I use CSS Grid versus Flexbox for page layout, and why?  
  **How it was used:** Informed my layout decisions. I used Grid for the hero and AI page layouts and Flexbox for navigation, footer, and pill lists.

- **Prompt:** Why is it better to compute values like the current year in JavaScript instead of hardcoding them in HTML?  
  **How it was used:** Guided my decision to implement a small JavaScript function that dynamically updates the footer year.

- **Prompt:** How does JavaScript interact with the DOM to update content on a page?  
  **How it was used:** Helped me understand DOM selection and updates before writing and organizing my own JavaScript module.

- **Prompt:** What accessibility concerns should I keep in mind when adding JavaScript behavior to a webpage?  
  **How it was used:** Influenced my use of semantic HTML, alt text for images, and ensuring interactive elements remained keyboard-accessible.

- **Prompt:** What are some simple creative additions I could add to a static personal homepage using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript?  
  **How it was used:** Helped me brainstorm ideas for a creative component. I selected and implemented my own solution independently.

### Implementation ownership statement

- All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in this project was written and implemented by me.
- Designed and customized the layout, color scheme, and spacing.
- AI was used only for conceptual guidance, explanations, and brainstorming.
- I did not copy-paste AI-generated code directly into the project.
- I reviewed, tested, and validated all code manually, including accessibility checks and W3C validation.
