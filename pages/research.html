          This page reflects on my path into computer science research and
          practical lessons I’ve learned along the way. Portions of the writing
          were generated with AI and edited by me for clarity and accuracy, in
          accordance with the CS 5610 AI disclosure requirement.

      <!-- Journey -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>How I got into research</h2>
        <p>
          I didn’t initially plan to pursue computer science research. My
          interest grew through coursework and projects that raised questions I
          couldn’t fully answer through implementation alone. Over time, I
          learned that research is less about having perfect ideas and more
          about asking clear questions and iterating based on feedback.

      <!-- Surprises -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>What surprised me</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Research is often slower and messier than coursework.</li>
          <li>Reading papers is a skill that improves with practice.</li>
          <li>Most ideas change significantly after discussion and review.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Tips -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Practical tips for getting started</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by understanding and extending existing work before proposing
            new ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep notes while reading papers, especially questions or unclear
            points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write early, even when ideas feel incomplete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Talk through ideas with others; clarity often comes from
            conversation.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>How this connects to my current work</h2>
        <p>
          My research background influences how I approach software projects.
          Even in front-end and web development, I treat design and technical
          choices as hypotheses that can be tested, evaluated, and refined over
          time.
